# QIIME 2 Support
If you're looking for help with QIIME 2, please visit the [QIIME 2 Forum](https://forum.qiime2.org). Start by searching to see if your question has already been answered, and if not feel free to create a new post. Posting to the QIIME 2 Forum is generally quicker than emailing the developers directly as multiple moderators are always tracking posts on the QIIME 2 Forum.

# Jobs
The Caporaso Lab is often hiring. Position types include research
software engineers, post-doctoral scholars, and graduate and undergraduate
students, project managers, and administrative assistants. Undergraduates should review [undergraduate job information](/undergrad/). All others, e-mail [Dr. Caporaso](mailto:greg.caporaso@nau.edu) to inquire about a position.

You can also find microbiome, bioinformatics, and QIIME 2 employment opportunities on the [QIIME 2 Forum's Job Board](https://forum.qiime2.org/c/Miscellaneous-categories/employment-opportunties). Feel free to post your own job announcements there as well - it's free. We just ask that posts are restricted to jobs relevant to the QIIME 2 user and developer community.
