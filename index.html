    <p>We are a <a href="https://qiime2.org" target="_blank">bioinformatics software engineering</a> lab focused
        on developing applications of microbiome science in human health, cancer detection and treatment, and environmental sustainability.</p>
    <p>We additionally lead activities focused on
        <a href="https://four-corners-scientific-computing.org" target="_blank">scientific computing education</a>,
        <a href="https://readIAB.org" target="_blank">bioinformatics education</a> and
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/qiime2" target="_blank">training</a>, and
        increasing diversity and inclusion in open source scientific software development.</p>
    <p>Our <a href="https://github.com/qiime2/" target="_blank">software</a> and
        <a href="https://github.com/applied-bioinformatics" target="_blank">educational content</a> are free
        and open source, and we're committed to
        <a href="https://forum.qiime2.org" target="_blank">increasing accessibility and building community</a>
